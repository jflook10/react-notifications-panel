## React Notifications Panel
Notification grid list with animated toast pop-ups. 

### Objectives

1. Messages are rendered in a grid like structure with a color code distinction depending on the priority of the message. The newest rules on top of the grid
2. The 3 priorities that we support are:
* 1 = alert (should be few and far between, no more than 10% of all messages)
* 2 = warning (20% - 40% of all message traffic)
* 3 = info (60% - 80% of all message traffic)
3. The colors to use are #F56236 for alert, #FCE788 for warning and #88FCA3 for info.
4. Alert messages appear in the top as a floating error that disappears in 2 seconds or another alert message takes its place.
5. A user may clear the grid of all messages.
